            About the First Female Teacher      
        </h1>
        <p>
            ☛ Savitribai Phule was born on 3 January 1831 at 
               the village of Naigaon in Satara District, 
               Maharashtra, India.
               <br><br>
            ☛ She was an early female teacher in India, Indian 
              social reformer, educationalist, and poet from 
              Maharashtra.
              <br><br>
            ☛ After completing her teacher's education, Savitribai Phule 
              started teaching girls at Poona. She did so alongside 
              Sagunabai Kshirsagar, sister of Jyotiba Phule who was a 
              revolutionary feminist as well as a mentor to Jyotirao.
              <br><br>
            ☛ Savitribai and Jyotiba together founded one of the early 
              modern Indian girls' school in Pune, at Bhidewada in 1848. 
              She strived to abolish discrimination and unfair 
              treatment of people on the basis of caste and gender.
              <br><br> 
            ☛ She and her husband were pioneers of women's education in India.
              They started their first school for girls in 1848 in Pune
              at Tatyasaheb Bhide's residence or Bhidewada.
              <br><br> 
            ☛ By the end of 1851, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were running 
              three different schools for girls in Pune. Combined, the three 
              schools had approximately one hundred and fifty students enrolled. 
              Like the curriculum, the teaching methods employed by the 
              three schools differed from those used in government schools.
              <br><br>
            ☛ As a result of this reputation, the number of girls receiving their 
              education at the Phule's schools outnumbered the number of boys 
              enrolled in government schools. Unfortunately, Savitribai and 
              Jyotirao Phule's success came with much resistance from the 
              local community with conservative views.
              <br><br>
            ☛ After moving out of Jyotirao's father's home, the Phule's 
              moved in with the family of one of Jyotirao's friends, Usman 
              Sheikh. It was there that Savitribai met a soon to be close 
              friend and colleague named Fatima Begum Sheikh.
              <br><br>
            ☛ After moving out of Jyotirao's father's home, the Phule's
              moved in with the family of one of Jyotirao's friends, 
              Usman Sheikh. It was there that Savitribai met a soon to be 
              close friend and colleague named Fatima Begum Sheikh. 
              <br><br> 
            ☛ According to Nasreen Sayyed, a leading scholar on Sheikh, 
              "Fatima Sheikh knew how to read and write already, her brother
              Usman who was a friend of Jyotiba, had encouraged Fatima to 
              take up the teacher training course. She went along with 
              Savitribai to the Normal School and they both graduated together.
              <br><br> 
            ☛ She was the first Muslim woman teacher of India". 
              Fatima and Savitribai opened a school in Sheikh's home in 1849.
              In the 1850s, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule established two 
              educational trusts. They were entitled: the Native Male School, 
              Pune and the Society for Promoting the Education of Mahars, Mangs, 
              and Etceteras. These two trusts ended up encompassing many schools 
              which were led by Savitribai Phule and later, Fatima Sheikh.
              <br><br> 
            ☛ Savitribai Phule was also an author and poet. She published 
               Kavya Phule in 1854 and Bavan Kashi Subodh Ratnakar in 1892, 
               and also a poem entitled "Go, Get Education" in which she 
               encouraged those who are oppressed to free themselves by obtaining 
               an education.
               <br><br> 
            ☛ Along with B. R. Ambedkar and Annabhau Sathe, Phule has become 
              an icon in particular for the backward classes. Women in local 
              branches of the Manavi Hakk Abhiyan frequently organise processions 
              on their jayanti.
              <br><br> 
            ☛ Pune City Corporation created a memorial for her in 1983.
              <br><br> 
            ☛ On 10 March 1998 a stamp was released by India Post in honour of Phule.
              <br><br> 
            ☛ In 2015, the University of Pune was renamed 
               as Savitribai Phule Pune University in her honour.
              <br><br>
            ☛ Savitribai's birthdate, 3 January, is celebrated as Balika Din 
            (little'Girl child day') in the whole of Maharashtra, 
            especially in girls' schools
